====================
Re-configure cluster
====================

This collection of how-to guides demonstrates how to change the configuration
of already running clusters. It shows how to change the plan of your cluster,
change the cluster configuration, and scale the number of
nodes in your cluster up and down. If you're wondering how to deploy a CrateDB
cluster in the first place, please follow the  :ref:`cluster deployment
tutorial <cloud-tutorials:cluster-deployment>`.
